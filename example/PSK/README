INTRO:
The stunnel/example/PSK directory contains some simple
tests for verifying that Stunnel is working with PSK.

The stunnel/example/PSK directory contains the .conf
and associated files for running an stunnel PSK proxy.
The simple TCP client/server or PSK client/server(running 
wolfSSL), may be found in stunnel/example/PSK/wolfExamples.

client1.conf:
 1. Accepts a TCP connection on port 11111
 2. Connects to port 11112 using PSK
 3. The client ID and key are in psk1.txt
    and read in as a string.

server.conf:
 1. accepts an incoming PSK connection on 11112
 2. connects to a TCP server running on 11113
 3. ciphers = PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256:PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA
    specifies in order of preference the cipher suites
    to chose from those supported by the client.
 4. The client ID and associated key are in psk.txt
    and read in as a string.


GETTING STARTED:
Install wolfSSL (in the root wolfSSL directory):
    ./configure --enable-stunnel
    make
    sudo make install

Install stunnel against wolfSSL (in the root 
Stunnel directory):
   ./configure --enable-wolfssl
   make
   sudo make install

In the stunnel/example/PSK/wolfExamples:
   make


RUNNING THE TESTS:
The examples may be run in the following combinations
(order of execution for the programs is important):

0. To test wolfs stunnel against itself:
    In the stunnel/example/PSK directory:
	stunnel server.conf
	stunnel client1.conf
    In the stunnel/example/PSK/wolfExamples directory:
        ./server-tcp
	./client-tcp 127.0.0.1

1. To test wolfs stunnel against wolf server-psk example:
    In the stunnel/example/PSK directory:
	stunnel client1.conf
    In the stunnel/example/PSK/wolfExamples directory:
        ./server-psk
	./client-tcp 127.0.0.1

2. To test wolfs stunnel against wolf client-psk example:
    In the stunnel/example/PSK directory:
	stunnel server.conf
    In the stunnel/example/PSK/wolfExamples directory:
        ./server-tcp
	./client-psk 127.0.0.1

Finally, it is possible to test wolf-Stunnel against
open-Stunnel using the directions provided for dual
installation, and test 0, using wolf-Stunnel for the 
client/server and open-Stunnel for the other.
