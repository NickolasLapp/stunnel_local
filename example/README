Instructions for conf1.conf

0. Before beginning, please setup wolfSSL and stunnel according to the setup
   guide provided to NetScout. In short, that guide will have you configure
   wolfSSL with --enable-stunnel, make and install, configure stunnel with
   --enable-wolfssl, and make.

I. Make the example directory.
    cd to the example directory, and run make

II. Startup stunnel.
    From the example directory, type ./../src/stunnel conf.conf
	i. This runs the stunnel executable with the provided configure script.
	ii. conf1.conf is setup to accept a tcp connection from a client on 11111
	    and negotiate an SSL connection with a SSL server on 11112.
III. Startup the SSL server.
    From the example directory, type ./echoserver-ssl/echoserver-ssl
	i. This starts up the ssl echoserver to listen on port 11112
IV. Run the echoclient.
    From the example direcotry, type ./echoclient-tcp/echoclient-tcp
        i. This runs the echoclient to connect to port 11111.

V. If everything works correctly, the echoserver will echo the client's text
   back to it.
   	i. From the echoclient, type break: to terminate the echoclient
	ii. From the echoclient, type quit: to terminate the echoserver

Note: To enable more helpful debugging information, please see the notes in the
      setup guide provided to NetScout about enabling wolfSSL debug messaging.

Instructions for conf2.conf and conf2.conf: These run against google.com using
google's OCSP server.

0. conf2.conf: This runs a positive test, although you can expect a 404, the
   connection was successfully established: meaning that OCSP passed.
    a. Follow steps 0, I, and II from Instructions for conf1.conf,
       with conf2.conf
    b. In your browser navigate to http://localhost:11111, which should show a
       google 404.

I. conf2.conf: This runs a negative test, the server's cert should be revoked.
     a. Follow steps 0, I, and II from Instructions for conf1.conf,
        with conf3.conf.
     b. In your browser navigate to http://localhost:11111, which should show a
        page not avaliable.  A look at the stunnel log output should show some
        indication that the cert was revoked. (e.g. OCSP Cert revoked)
